Follow the instruction given below to run this react web-application:

Step 1: Set Up Your React Environment: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Then, create a new React project using Create React App.

Step 2: Install Necessary Packages: You'll need packages like Axios for making API requests and any additional packages for styling or UI components you choose to use.

Step 3: Create Components: Break down your application into reusable components. You might have components for the search bar, weather display, error messages, etc.

Step 4: Fetch Weather Data: Utilize a weather API like OpenWeatherMap to fetch weather data based on the city name entered by the user. You'll need to sign up for an API key.

Step 5: Display Weather Information: Once you have the weather data, update your UI to display the relevant information like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Step 6: Implement Search Functionality: Allow users to input a city name and fetch weather information for that city.

Step 7: Design and Styling: Design an appealing and responsive layout for your dashboard using CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI.

Step 8: Responsive Design: Ensure your dashboard looks good and works well on both desktop and mobile devices by utilizing responsive design principles.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
